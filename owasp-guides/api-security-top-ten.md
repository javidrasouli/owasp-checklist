# OWASP Top Ten

The OWASP Top Ten is a list of the top ten most critical web application security risks. This list is periodically updated to reflect the current threat landscape. It serves as a guide to help organizations prioritize their security efforts and protect their web applications from common vulnerabilities.

## Current OWASP Top Ten

1. **Injection:** Protect against SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection attacks by validating and sanitizing user inputs.

   - **Explanation:** Injection vulnerabilities occur when an application allows untrusted data to be interpreted as code, potentially leading to malicious code execution and unauthorized data access. Common injection types include SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection. To protect your application, validate and sanitize user inputs and use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent injection attacks.

2. **Broken Authentication:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms and session management to prevent unauthorized access.

   - **Explanation:** Broken authentication vulnerabilities arise when an application fails to properly verify and manage user identities and sessions. Attackers can exploit this to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or escalate privileges. Secure your authentication processes with strong password policies, session timeout, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

3. **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. Avoid exposing sensitive information through APIs or client-side code.

   - **Explanation:** Sensitive data exposure occurs when sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or personal data, is not properly protected. Implement encryption for data at rest and during transmission using strong cryptographic protocols. Avoid exposing sensitive data through insecure APIs or client-side code. Employ access controls to restrict data access to authorized users.

4. **XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks:** Disable XML external entity processing and use safe parsing libraries.

   - **Explanation:** XXE attacks occur when an application parses XML input from untrusted sources and allows the inclusion of external entities. Attackers can exploit this to disclose internal files or perform denial of service attacks. To mitigate XXE attacks, disable external entity processing and use safe XML parsing libraries. Always validate and sanitize XML input.

5. **Broken Access Control:** Enforce proper access controls and authorization checks to prevent unauthorized actions.

   - **Explanation:** Broken access control occurs when an application does not properly restrict user access to certain resources or actions. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality. Implement access controls and authorization checks to ensure that users can only access what they are authorized to. Validate user identity and permissions on both the client and server sides.

6. **Security Misconfiguration:** Review and secure your application and server configurations. Disable unnecessary features and services.

   - **Explanation:** Security misconfiguration vulnerabilities result from improper configuration settings, such as default credentials, overly permissive permissions, or unnecessary services and features enabled. Regularly review and secure your application and server configurations to minimize the attack surface. Disable unnecessary features and services, and follow security best practices.

7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Validate and sanitize user inputs and use security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP).

   - **Explanation:** XSS vulnerabilities occur when an application allows untrusted data to be included in web pages, leading to the execution of malicious scripts in users' browsers. This can result in data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of web pages. Prevent XSS attacks by validating and sanitizing user inputs and using security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of executable scripts.

8. **Insecure Deserialization:** Avoid insecure deserialization by using safe libraries and handling user-supplied serialized data with caution.

   - **Explanation:** Insecure deserialization vulnerabilities occur when an application deserializes untrusted data, which can lead to remote code execution or other malicious actions. Protect against this by using safe deserialization libraries and handling serialized data with caution. Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.

9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities:** Regularly update and patch libraries, frameworks, and dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

   - **Explanation:** Using outdated or vulnerable components can expose your application to known security issues. Keep your dependencies up to date and apply security patches promptly to reduce the risk of known vulnerabilities. Utilize tools and services that can assist in monitoring and managing third-party components.

10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring:** Implement proper logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.

    - **Explanation:** Insufficient logging and monitoring make it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents, potentially allowing attackers to operate undetected. Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring practices to identify and respond to security threats effectively. Monitor critical application and system events, set up alerts, and establish an incident response plan.
