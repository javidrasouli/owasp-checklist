# Backend Security Checklist

This checklist provides a set of security best practices and considerations for securing the backend of your web applications. Following these guidelines can help protect your application from common security threats.

## Authentication and Authorization

- [ ] Implement strong user authentication.
- [ ] Use proper session management techniques.
- [ ] Enforce strict access control based on roles and permissions.
- [ ] Protect against account enumeration and brute force attacks.
- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where applicable.

## Data Security

- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- [ ] Implement proper input validation and output encoding.
- [ ] Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and NoSQL injection.
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all data before interacting with databases.
- [ ] Use parameterized queries or prepared statements.

## API Security

- [ ] Secure API endpoints with proper authentication and authorization.
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and throttling for APIs.
- [ ] Validate and sanitize inputs to prevent API injection attacks.
- [ ] Use the principle of least privilege for API access.

## Server-Side Security

- [ ] Keep server software and libraries up to date.
- [ ] Disable unnecessary server features and services.
- [ ] Implement proper error handling to avoid information leakage.
- [ ] Secure server configurations (e.g., remove default accounts and passwords).

## Logging and Monitoring

- [ ] Implement centralized logging for security events.
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS).
- [ ] Regularly review and analyze logs for signs of suspicious activity.
- [ ] Implement alerting for security incidents.

## File Uploads

- [ ] Restrict file types and sizes for uploads.
- [ ] Scan uploaded files for malware and viruses.
- [ ] Store uploaded files in a secure location outside the web root.
- [ ] Use unique filenames to prevent overwriting or predictable access.

## Database Security

- [ ] Apply the principle of least privilege for database access.
- [ ] Use strong, unique passwords for database accounts.
- [ ] Regularly back up the database and test restoration procedures.
- [ ] Monitor and log database activity.
