# Frontend Security Checklist

This checklist provides a set of security best practices and considerations for securing the frontend of your web applications. Following these guidelines can help protect your application from common security threats.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention

- [ ] Validate and sanitize user-generated content.
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
- [ ] Use libraries and frameworks with built-in XSS protection.

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention

- [ ] Implement anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing requests.
- [ ] Validate and enforce the origin of incoming requests.

## Content Security

- [ ] Avoid embedding sensitive data in client-side code.
- [ ] Implement secure cookie flags (e.g., HttpOnly, Secure).
- [ ] Protect against clickjacking attacks using X-Frame-Options or Content Security Policy.

## Client-Side Storage

- [ ] Use secure storage mechanisms (e.g., local storage, session storage).
- [ ] Avoid storing sensitive data in client-side storage.

## Secure Communication

- [ ] Use HTTPS for all data transmission.
- [ ] Implement secure cookie settings (e.g., SameSite attribute).
- [ ] Avoid mixed content (HTTP content on HTTPS pages).

## Dependency Management

- [ ] Keep frontend libraries and frameworks up to date.
- [ ] Monitor for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- [ ] Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit script sources.

## Mobile Considerations

- [ ] Securely store sensitive data on mobile devices.
- [ ] Implement proper authentication and session management for mobile apps.
- [ ] Protect against reverse engineering and code tampering.

## Usability and Accessibility

- [ ] Ensure that security measures do not compromise user experience.
- [ ] Provide accessibility features for all users, including those with disabilities.
